# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aimed to design a web-based system for a client who wanted to provide customers with tools to schedule driving lessons, access training materials, and prepare for their driving tests.

# What did you do particularly well?
I created clear and detailed UML diagrams that effectively illustrated system interactions and supported client requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the sequence diagrams to include more detailed edge cases, ensuring that all potential user interactions are accounted for.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I analyzed the business requirements and interview transcripts to capture key functionalities and integrated these into intuitive system features. Considering the user’s needs ensures the system is functional, user-friendly, and directly addresses the client’s goals.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I use a requirements-driven approach, starting with interviews and documentation to understand the problem. In the future, I would incorporate more iterative feedback cycles with users to refine and validate system designs.
